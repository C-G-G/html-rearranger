  2. Create a list to hold the below ground veggies.
  3. Add the heading and list to the document.
  4. Create a second heading for “Above ground veggies” and add it to the document.
  5. Create a list to hold the above ground veggies and add it to the document.
  6. Loop over the veggies that exist in the HTML currently and add them to the appropriate list.
  7. Remove the veggies from the old list.
  8. Completely remove the original list.
